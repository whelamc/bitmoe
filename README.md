## 技术栈

* Next.js 13: A server-rendered application framework based on React, which provides excellent SEO performance and fast page response time.
* Tailwind CSS: A feature-rich CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-defined classes and utility tools, making it easy to write and customize styles.
* Framer Motion: A powerful animation library that offers a variety of animation effects and interactive features, enhancing the user experience.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
